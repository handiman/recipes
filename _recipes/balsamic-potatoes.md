# Balsamic potatoes

These spuds really are a phenomenon. They look dark and gnarly, and they’re beautiful yet kind of charmingly ugly at the same time. The volume of balsamic used here requires you to have faith. Trust me – incredible things will happen.

*   extra virgin olive oil

# Tillagning
<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. </li><li>Peel the potatoes, cut them into even-sized chunky wedges and parboil in a large pan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes. </li><li>Drain in a colander, leave to steam dry completely, then divide the wedges between two large roasting trays. </li><li>Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into each tray, and season with sea salt and black pepper. Toss together and spread out into a single layer. Roast for 45 minutes, or until lightly golden, tossing gently halfway.</li><li>Meanwhile, peel and slice the onions and garlic. When the time’s up on the potatoes, scatter over the onions and garlic, then pour over the balsamic. </li><li>Roast for 50 minutes to 1 hour, using a fish slice to carefully turn the potatoes in all the sticky balsamic yumminess a few times during cooking, and adding the butter and thyme leaves to the party for the last 10 minutes. In the spirit of this bonkers but genius dish, if you’re in any doubt when you turn them that it’s doing the right thing, just be brave and add an extra drizzle of balsamic, then return to the oven until gnarly and roasted. </li><li>Serve on a platter sprinkled with the rocket. This is amazing served as a side dish with any roasted or grilled meat, but is also brilliant as part of a Boxing Day buffet spread with cold cuts of meat. I’ve even enjoyed it as a lovely lunch with a big old salad. Delicious.</li></ol>
