# Lamb kofta flatbreads

This colourful family favourite is really fun to put together. Quick pickled cabbage brings a hit of extra flavour, and with just five ingredients, it’s an easy one to rustle up. I’m using shop-bought tortillas here, but feel free to make your own – simply check out the easy swaps below to find out how. Have fun with it!
