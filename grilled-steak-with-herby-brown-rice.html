<p>Blackening peppers over a flame or under the grill is a brilliant way to inject some delicious smoky, sweet flavours into your dish. Steaming them in a covered bowl is super important, too – it’ll help loosen the skins, which will make peeling them a lot easier. Sliced up and tossed through the grilled steak and its juices, then served with herby rice make this a brilliant, flavour-packed dinner. Plus, store cupboard staple, brown rice, contains a bumper source of vitamins and minerals, including selenium for efficient immune system function.</p>
