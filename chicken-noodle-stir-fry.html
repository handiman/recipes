    <h1 id="chicken-noodle-stir-fry">Chicken noodle stir-fry</h1>

<p>This recipe demonstrates the principle of cooking hard and fast. I’m using chicken here, but you could try prawns, salmon or tofu instead – the key is to get everything lined up in order of cooking time, adding the ingredients that take the longest to the pan first. I’ve paired my chicken with broccoli, but feel free to add more veg, or mix it up with what you’ve got. Have fun with it.</p>
