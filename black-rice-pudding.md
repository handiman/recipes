# Tillagning
<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Cook the black rice according to the packet instructions, overcooking it slightly so it’s plump and sticky, then drain and cool. </li><li>Meanwhile, peel and destone the mango, blitz the flesh in a blender with the lime juice until smooth, and pour into a bowl. </li><li>Separately, toast the hazelnuts and coconut in a dry frying pan until lightly golden, then bash up in a pestle and mortar. </li><li>Peel the bananas and tear into the blender, then blitz with the hazelnut milk, vanilla extract and two-thirds of the black rice – depending on the sweetness of your bananas, you could also add a teaspoon of honey. </li><li>Once smooth, stir that back through the rest of the rice – this will give you great texture and colour. Divide between four nice jars or bowls. </li><li>Spoon over the blitzed mango, squeeze half a passion fruit over each one, then delicately spoon over the yoghurt and sprinkle with the hazelnuts and coconut.</li></ol>
